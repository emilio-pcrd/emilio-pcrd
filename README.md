# Emilio Picard | ENS Paris Saclay - Sorbonne University

I'm currently a Master 2 student at **ENS Paris-Saclay**, where I'm specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. My research passion is driven by a strong interest in applying machine and deep learning methods to music, audio and signal processing. I'm also interested in Medical and Neuroscience applications.

Outside of academics, I'm an artist, beatmaker & composer. You can check out my music on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/soleer) (Spotify, Deezer, etc).
