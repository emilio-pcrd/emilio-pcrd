I'm currently a Master 2 student at **ENS Paris-Saclay**, specializing in **Mathematics** and **Programming** applied to **Machine and Deep Learning**. My research passion is fueled by a strong interest in applying machine and deep learning methods to **music, audio, and signal processing**, as well as applications in **medical and neuroscience** domains.

ðŸŽ¶ Outside of academics, I'm an **artist, beatmaker, and composer**. You can check out my music on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/soleer) (Spotify, Deezer, etc).
