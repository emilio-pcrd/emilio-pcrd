# Emilio Picard @ ENS Paris Saclay | Sorbonne University

---

I'm currently a Master 2 student at **ENS Paris-Saclay**, where I'm specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. My research passion is driven by a strong interest in applying machine and deep learning methods to music, audio and signal processing. I'm also interested in Medical and Neuroscience applications.

Outside of academics, I'm an artist, beatmaker & composer. You can check out my music on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/soleer) (Spotify, Deezer, etc).

## Prjects

Here are some projects I've been working on, focused on **machine learning** and **deep learning** topics (Master 1 projects):

### 1. **[Conformal Prediction](https://github.com/emilio-pcrd/project1)**
   - **Description**: This work has been done during my second semester of a master's degree in Sorbonne University, under the supervision of Claire Boyer , and has been part of a course called Research and Study Work .

Related to the field of Machine Learning, this work leads to a simple general understanding of Conformal Prediction , a modern issue which becomes very important for high risk settings in many domains, such as medicine diagnostics, wheather reports or either environment, where a wrong prediction could lead to consequential model failures.

### 2. **[Signatures for Time Series](https://github.com/emilio-pcrd/project2)**
   - **Description**: Statistics and Machine Learning for time series, using Signatures & Sensitivity analysis. This repository tackles the work (notebook) done during my 2 months internship at Institut Mathématique de Toulouse. The report of this not now available.

### 3. **[Variational inference for Bayesian linear regression](https://github.com/emilio-pcrd/project3)**
   - **Description**: This project is in French. En colaboration avec Paul Lefranc (Sorbonne université).
     Sujet: Application d'une approche variationnelle pour un modèle de régression linéaire bayésien. Ce projet contient un notebook avec du code et des calculs mathématiques utiles pour la construction de l'algorithme **CAVI**.
