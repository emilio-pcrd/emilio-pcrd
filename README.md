I'm currently a Master 2 student at **ENS Paris-Saclay**, specializing in **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning**. My research passion is fueled by a strong interest in applying machine and deep learning methods to **music, audio, and signal processing**, as well as applications in **medical and neuroscience** domains.

ðŸŽ¶ Outside of academics, I'm an **artist, beatmaker, and composer**. You can check out my music on [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/soleer) (Spotify, Deezer, etc).

## ðŸŽ“ Projects

Here are some of my key projects, with a focus on **machine learning** and **deep learning** (Master 1 projects):

### 1. **[Conformal Prediction](https://github.com/emilio-pcrd/Conformal-Prediction)**
   - **Description**: Conducted during my master's degree at Sorbonne University under the supervision of Claire Boyer, this project was part of the **Research and Study Work** course.
   - **Objective**: Understanding **Conformal Prediction**, a critical approach in high-risk domains such as medical diagnostics and environmental forecasting, where predictive accuracy is crucial.
   - **Keywords**: Uncertainty quantification, Risk mitigation, Machine learning

### 2. **[Signatures for Time Series](https://github.com/emilio-pcrd/Learning-with-signatures)**
   - **Description**: This project covers **statistical and machine learning approaches for time series** using Signatures and Sensitivity Analysis, developed during my internship at **Institut MathÃ©matique de Toulouse**.
   - **Note**: The project is based on notebooks created for this internship; a report will be shared when available.

### 3. **[Variational Inference for Bayesian Linear Regression](https://github.com/emilio-pcrd/Variational-_inference_for_bayesian_models)**
   - **Description**: This project, in collaboration with Paul Lefranc at Sorbonne University, involves applying a **variational approach** to Bayesian linear regression models. This repository includes notebooks with code and calculations for building the **CAVI** algorithm.
   - **Language**: French
